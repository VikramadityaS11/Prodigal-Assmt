Christopher Davis, you are authorizing six monthly payments of two hundred five dollars and seventy five cents starting today, to be charged automatically to your card ending in five six on the seventh of each month.

  },
  {
    "role": "User",

    "stime": 305,

    "stime": 310,
    "utterance": "Maybe one hundred?",

  },
  {
    "role": "Assistant",
    "stime": 312,
    "utterance": "Let me see what I can arrange. I can do an initial payment of one hundred dollars today, and then we'd need to adjust the remaining balance. That would make it about six payments of one hundred eighty nine dollars and eight cents. Would that work?",
    "etime": 330
  },
  {
    "role": "User",
    "stime": 330,

  },
  {
    "role": "Assistant",
    "stime": 336,
    "utterance": "Let me clarify. The first payment today would be one hundred dollars. Then you'd have five remaining payments of one hundred eighty nine dollars and eight cents to pay off the remaining balance. So it's six total payments.",

  },
  {
    "role": "User",
    "stime": 351,

  {
    "role": "User",

  },
  {
    "role": "Assistant",
    "stime": 368,

    "etime": 380
  },
  {
    "role": "User",
    "stime": 380,
    "utterance": "Actually, yeah. Let me just make a one-time payment of one hundred dollars now, and I'll call back about the rest.",

  {
    "role": "Assistant",
    "stime": 388,

  {
    "role": "Assistant",
    "stime": 473,
    "utterance": "Yes, absolutely. All of our conversations are noted in your account. When you call back, any agent will be able to see that you made a payment today and that you were interested in setting up a payment plan for the remaining balance.",
